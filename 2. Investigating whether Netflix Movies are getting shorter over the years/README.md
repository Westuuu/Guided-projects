# Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office

This is a guided project from DataCamp that taught me how to create more advanced plots. I started by creating a DataFrame with provided data. After that I visualised it and noticed that duration of movies was decreasing over years. At this point I imported data provided as CSV file and prepared it by filtering for movies. That allowed me to visualise it on a scatter plot. I couldn't draw any conclusions from that plot, so I filtered the movies by genre and colored the markers. Now the graph clearly shows that most of the short movies in recent years have a genre: "Children", "Documentaries" and "Stand-up". I think that with current knowledge we can safely assume that movies are not getting shorter over the years but there are more shows and programs that make it seem like duration of movies is getting shorter.

## Things I learned during this project:
* How to import data from CSV
* How to filter data for needed informations
* To not make conclusions too quickly, analyse what and why I see something
* How to make clear scatter plots

## Ideas for later updates:
* Show mean and median duration of film over the years
* Exclude certain genres of movies
* Filter by number of movies over the years
