# Helicopter escapes

The aim of this project was to determine in which countries the most attempts of escape using helicopters occurred. I started by getting the data from a [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_helicopter_prison_escapes) article. Once it was done I prepared the data that was necessary for the project. I finished the project by visualizing data on a graph and summing all the attempts that happened in each country.

## Things I learned
* How to prepare desired data
* How to visualize data on a graph
* Ways of manipulating data (sorting, extracting)

## Ideas for future updates
* Include how many attempts succeeded and failed
* Check if there were multiple attempts of escaping from a single prison
* Check if there were multiple attempts of escaping by the same person
